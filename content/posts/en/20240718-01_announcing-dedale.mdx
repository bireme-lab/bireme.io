## With Dédale, develop your React.js email templates using an optimized browser-based editor

**Paris, July 18, 2024** — Bireme Lab, creator of online subscription services (SaaS) for developers and small businesses, launches an online platform, [Dédale](/dedale), optimized for and offering all the necessary features for email template development.

With Dédale, developers and solopreneurs can develop and centralize their email templates by:
- taking advantage of adapted tools to write code using [React.js](https://react.dev/),
- verifying compliance with advanced preview features
- exporting to their various tools: ESP (mass email sending services), or transactional communication software (such as a dedicated user authentication service).

## The advantages of Dédale for email template development

In the landscape of subscription services, email communication remains an essential pillar for a company's business and product development.
This channel continues to be a major asset, whether for marketing campaigns or transactional messages.
Email remains a privileged point of contact with current and potential users, requiring constant attention and continuous optimization to maximize engagement and conversion.
The interest for a company

Email template design then becomes necessary to:
- ensure brand consistency,
- offer time savings,
- give a professional image,
- allow content personalization and segmentation,
- optimize conversion in the case of mass communication.
- ensure clarity of the message and actions the user must take in the case of a transactional exchange.

This requires:
- a development phase,
- the ability to ensure good compatibility with most existing clients such as Gmail or Outlook,
- thinking about template storage to promote their reuse.

Regarding the development phase, Dédale relies on [React Email](https://react.email) for writing the email code, allowing the use of modern development methods offering a better experience than developing in HTML or using [MJML](https://mjml.io/).

Thanks to Dédale, developers no longer need to launch a local environment on their computer. The platform integrates everything necessary for an optimal experience:
- automatic download and import of external dependencies (via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)),
- support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
- experience similar to using the popular editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

During export, Dédale transforms the code written in React into a highly compatible HTML format that can be easily integrated into most existing services.

Regarding compatibility issues, Dédale offers an environment and features allowing preview of templates in context, such as the use of dynamic variables, thanks to a simple-to-use API that can be manipulated from the interface.
Additionally, Dédale detects, in the background, all HTML and CSS properties that are weakly compatible with email clients and alerts the developer of any potential display issues.

Finally, Dédale stands out as an intermediary allowing centralization of email templates to simplify search and addition of modifications before export and use in third-party services such as [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) or [Clerk](https://clerk.com/).

Access to Dédale is completely free with a limit of 1 template per user.
An account, also free, will be necessary to exceed this limit and unlock [additional benefits, the list of which is available on this page](/dedale).
